## My process

The first thing I did was setup my repository through Git and GitHub. Next, I started with the HTML. I made containers for each style on the QR Code card. After that, I gave each div container a descriptive class name. That was simple. Then, I went into the CSS file and styled the HTML accordingly to how I viewed the preview image. The most important thing for me was the padding, max-width, margin, and width properties. That was the big lesson for me in this project. Those properties are what got the images and text aligned correctly, and lastly Flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I want to focus more on CSS layout, responsive design, and maybe some more projects utilizing width, margin, padding, and min-height. I enjoy Flexbox, but I need to learn CSS grid.
